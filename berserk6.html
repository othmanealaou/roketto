                <h1 class="h1">Kushan Empire</h1>
                <p>Kushan is a large empire ruled by Emperor Ganishka. The empire is located to the far east of the Holy
                See nations. It is not a monolithic empire - rather, it comprises a royal house over lesser ones.
                This led to grudges between them. One such house is the Bakiraka clan. Its military combines
                large, well organized conventional forces with various supernatural creatures and human magic
                users. It was engaged in a protracted war with the allied nations under the Holy See,
                having invaded and occupied much of Midland.</p><br>

                <p>Kushan's strongest human forces consist of their large cavalry and many war elephants.Their
                divisions consist of several hundred horsemen each. They use Bakiraka and scout units which move in
                large forces, and the supply lines have many archers. One Kushan commander
                attributes their success in protracted military campaigns such as the current conflict with Midland to
                the country's policy of using war slaves and captured soldiers from enemy armies compelled to fight for
                the Kushan as cannon fodder to bear the brunt of the casualties. They also developed war machines,
                such as cannons, siege towers, galleasses and a mobile palace surrounded by imperial
                guards.</p><br>
                <br>
                <div class="kodfun-galeri">
                    <div style="background-image: url(./assets/photo396.webp);"></div>
                    <div style="background-image: url(./assets/photo414.webp);"></div>
                </div>
                <p>Apart from fielding large amounts of human soldiers, the Kushan also utilize different beasts created
                from magic, known as the pishaca gana. These beasts are controlled by spellcasters that house
                within fog that resembles the visage of Ganishka. These spellcasters, who are led by Daiba and work
                alongside regular military, are known as harashada. The Pishacha are complimented by daka, the result
                of human fetuses being infused with the evil in the Astral World via the Man-Made Beherit. Daka are
                transported by warships.</p><br>

                <p>The Kushan army was commanded by fear.It utilized immense cruelty in their conquest of Midland,
                slaughtering entire cities and mounting their remains on statues, buildings and in palaces. Women
                were taken captives to either be sold off as slaves, or to be utilized for creating daka.</p><br>

                <p>As Griffith rose to prominence, the Kushan armies would suffer numerous decisive defeats against his
                apostle army. Although the carnage of these soldiers was immense, Griffith allowed
                Kushan soldiers to swell his ranks. Subsequently, Ganishka's defeat by the hand of Femto lead to the
                fall of the Kushan Empire. Since then, Kushan soldiers and citizens are allowed to live in peace in
                Falconia.</p><br>

                <p>After the Great Roar of the Astral World, Kushans are still in control of a large city as well as its
                surrounding waters. Their forces are capable of sophisticated naval attacks and seemingly have the
                allegiance of the Bakiraka clan and the advice of Daiba. On top of that, they are informed about the
                rise of Falconia and its geographical location.</p><br>
